# Dynamic `<area>` Tags
Update HTML area tags dynamically for responsive web design and clickable images.

If you have ever used `<map>` and `<area>` tags then you know that updating the image size or changing the page size/resolution different will break your coordinates and your links within your images. Frustrating right?

Well, this repo contains a small JavaScript file to help with updating the area tag coords dynamically to avoid this issue! ðŸŽ‰

You should just be able to download the script.js file, point to it from your webpage, and then all your `<area>` tags will update on page load and whenever the page size is updated.
